    <string name="sadInfo">Being sad is different than being depressed even though it doesn’t sound so. A sad person knows the reason of his distress but a depressed person doesn’t. A sad person is: \n\n - I am sad because I failed the exams. \n\nHere an individual knows exactly that the source of his distress is failure in exams. To your surprise a depressed will be sad because of exams but would never be able to point out exactly what is his reason of distress which makes it even harder to deal with.</string>
